# OmnitrAIce Implementation Plan Status

This document tracks the status of the implementation plan for unifying the OmnitrAIce project.

## Completed Tasks

### Core Unification
- ✅ Rebuilt `revolutionary_omniagent.py` as the unified integration point
- ✅ Created the unified launcher (`run.py`) with comprehensive CLI options
- ✅ Implemented configuration loading from YAML/JSON files
- ✅ Set up error handling and logging infrastructure

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated the main README.md with unified architecture information
- ✅ Created architecture documentation
- ✅ Created migration guide
- ✅ Documented the revolutionary first-principles approach

### Configuration System
- ✅ Created YAML configuration file structure
- ✅ Implemented configuration loading in the unified launcher
- ✅ Added robust parameter handling

### Directory Organization
- ✅ Created `legacy` directory for obsolete files
- ✅ Created `config/config_files` for configuration files
- ✅ Created `docs` directory for documentation files

## In Progress Tasks

### Testing Infrastructure
- 🔄 Set up testing framework
- 🔄 Create unit tests for the unified agent
- 🔄 Create integration tests for the complete workflow

### Web UI Updates
- 🔄 Update Web UI to use the unified agent
- 🔄 Add new configuration options to the UI
- 🔄 Implement advanced revolutionary metrics display

### Code Cleanup
- 🔄 Move obsolete launchers to the legacy directory
- 🔄 Standardize error handling across all modules
- 🔄 Improve type hinting throughout the codebase

## Pending Tasks

### Refactoring
- ⏱️ Reorganize core modules into a more structured layout:
  ```
  omnitrace/
  ├── agents/             # Specialized agent implementations
  ├── core/               # Core functionality
  ├── generation/         # Generation capabilities
  ├── utils/              # Utility modules
  ├── ui/                 # User interfaces
  └── run.py              # Unified entry point
  ```

### Advanced Integration
- ⏱️ Implement `RevolutionaryAgent` base class/protocol
- ⏱️ Standardize the interface for all agents
- ⏱️ Improve dependency injection between components

### CI/CD Setup
- ⏱️ Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- ⏱️ Add automated testing
- ⏱️ Add code coverage reporting

## Next Steps

1. Complete the testing infrastructure
2. Update the Web UI to use the unified agent
3. Move obsolete files to the legacy directory
4. Begin the refactoring process for better code organization
5. Implement the `RevolutionaryAgent` protocol
