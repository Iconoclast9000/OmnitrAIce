# OmnitrAIce Development Roadmap

> Vision by **CraigFineTuned** - Pioneering small model excellence

## Philosophy

OmnitrAIce was created with the conviction that smaller, more efficient language models can achieve revolutionary results when guided by first-principles thinking. This project challenges the assumption that larger models are always better, demonstrating that focused, efficient approaches can yield superior outcomes while being more accessible and practical.

This roadmap outlines how we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with smaller models.
