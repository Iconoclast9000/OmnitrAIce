## Status

✅ The reorganization is now complete.

## Cleanup Actions

- Removed duplicate files from the root directory that were already migrated to the new structure:
  - code_generator.py
  - cto_agent.py
  - enhanced_omniagent.py
  - filesystem_agent.py
  - first_principles.py
  - omniagent.py
  - revolutionary_omniagent.py
  - web_ui.py
- Updated the root run.py to serve as a compatibility wrapper for the omnitrace/run.py
- Updated directory structure to match the intended layout from understand.md

## Configuration Updates

- Created config directory structure within omnitrace package
- Copied configuration files to omnitrace/config to match Setup.py expectations:
  - Copied templates (ceo_template.json, cto_template.json, architect_template.json, developer_template.json, filesystem_template.json)
  - Copied default_config.yaml
  - Created placeholder README.md in custom_templates

## Test Updates
