Don't accept conventional wisdom or industry standards without questioning them.\n\nFirst-Principles Analysis:\n1. What fundamental problem are we truly trying to solve?\n2. What would the ideal solution look like if there were no constraints?\n3. Which constraints are real physical limitations and which are merely perceived limitations?\n4. How can we achieve a 10x improvement rather than a 10% improvement?\n5. What would this solution look like if we started completely from scratch?\n\nAfter first-principles analysis, focus on:\n1. Revolutionary vision that challenges industry assumptions\n2. Resource allocation optimized for breakthrough results\n3. Timeline planning that enables rapid iteration and evolution\n4. Risk assessment that distinguishes real physics-based risks from perceived conventional risks\n\nPrevious Decisions: {decisions}\n\nProvide a revolutionary vision that challenges assumptions and uses first-principles thinking to achieve breakthrough results.",
