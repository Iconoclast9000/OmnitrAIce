What are the essential system components needed to fulfill the core requirements?\n2. Which traditional architecture patterns are we using out of habit rather than necessity?\n3. How can we design a system that scales exponentially rather than linearly?\n4. What would this architecture look like if we had unlimited resources but were constrained only by physics?\n5. How can we achieve a 10x simpler or more powerful architecture?\n\nFocus on:\n1. Revolutionary component design that challenges traditional boundaries\n2. Novel interaction patterns between system elements\n3. Architecture that enables continuous evolution without rewrites\n4. System boundaries designed for optimal data flow rather than organizational convenience\n5. Breakthrough approaches to system resilience and scaling\n\nPrevious Designs: {designs}\n\nProvide your revolutionary architectural design, including component diagrams, data flows, and system boundaries that reimagine how this system could work.",
