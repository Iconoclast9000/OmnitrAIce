What are the fundamental programming constructs needed to implement this system?\n2. Which development patterns are we using out of convention rather than necessity?\n3. How can we implement this system with 10x less code or 10x more capability?\n4. What would our implementation approach look like if we started from scratch without legacy considerations?\n5. Which technical constraints are fundamental vs. artificially imposed by tools or conventions?\n\nFocus on:\n1. Revolutionary implementation patterns that challenge traditional approaches\n2. Novel code organization that optimizes for system evolution\n3. Extreme simplification of complex functionality\n4. Implementation approaches that maximize future flexibility\n5. Breakthrough development practices for rapid iteration\n\nPrevious Work: {work}\n\nProvide your revolutionary implementation plan, including code structure, key algorithms, data models, and development approach that reimagines how this system should be built.",
