# Documentation Synchronization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan to bring all OmnitrAIce documentation in sync with the actual implementation. We've identified discrepancies between the documentation and the code, with the documentation describing a more complex system than what's currently implemented.

## Files to Update

1. **GOALS_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
2. **misc/docs/agent_customization_guide.md**
3. **misc/docs/agent_hierarchy.html**

## Key Changes

### 1. GOALS_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md

#### Current Issues:
- Claims all agent types are implemented when only CEO, Architect, and Developer are present
- Describes a complex directory structure that doesn't exist in the actual project
- Indicates high test coverage percentages that aren't visible in the project

#### Changes to Make:
- Change implementation status of unimplemented agents from "Complete" to "Planned"
- Update the directory structure to match the actual flat project structure
- Revise test coverage claims to reflect current state
- Add a clear distinction between current implementation and future plans
- Update system integration and coordination system statuses to reflect actual state

### 2. agent_customization_guide.md

#### Current Issues:
- Generally accurate but does not acknowledge that some agents shown in other documentation are not yet implemented
- Could benefit from troubleshooting information and future roadmap

#### Changes to Make:
- Add a note clarifying which agents are currently implemented and which are planned
- Add troubleshooting section for common customization issues
- Add section about planned enhancements to the customization system
- Keep the core instructions as they remain applicable

### 3. agent_hierarchy.html

#### Current Issues:
- Shows all seven agent types without indicating which are implemented and which are planned
- Could mislead users into thinking all agents are currently functional

#### Changes to Make:
- Add visual indicators (badges) to distinguish implemented vs. planned agents
- Add explanatory text about implementation status at the top of the diagram
- Add section explaining the roadmap for implementing planned agents
- Update the diagram's styling to make the status distinction clear
- Add last updated date

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update GOALS_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Revise component statuses to accurately reflect implementation
   - Update directory structure section
   - Add clear future development roadmap
   - Distinguish between current implementation and aspirational goals

2. **Update agent_customization_guide.md**
   - Add clarification about implemented vs. planned agents
   - Add troubleshooting and future enhancements sections
   - Preserve all valid customization instructions

3. **Update agent_hierarchy.html**
   - Add styling for "planned" agent cards
   - Add "PLANNED" badges to unimplemented agents
   - Add explanatory text about implementation status
   - Add future development information
   - Update footer with current date

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Clarity**: Users will clearly understand what's implemented now vs. future plans
2. **Realistic Expectations**: New users won't be confused by documentation promising features that aren't yet implemented
3. **Preserved Vision**: The roadmap and future plans remain documented, preserving the project's vision
4. **Consistency**: All documentation will consistently represent the same system state
5. **Transparency**: Openly acknowledging the development status builds trust with users and contributors

## Future Maintenance

To prevent documentation drift in the future:

1. **Documentation Reviews**: Add documentation review to the development process
2. **Version Tagging**: Tag documentation with version numbers
3. **Implementation Status Indicators**: Continue using clear status indicators (âœ…, ðŸŸ¡, â­•) in documentation
4. **Automated Checks**: Consider implementing automated checks for documentation consistency

## Conclusion

By implementing these changes, the OmnitrAIce documentation will accurately reflect the current implementation state while preserving the vision for future development. This will improve the user experience and make it easier for new contributors to understand the project.
